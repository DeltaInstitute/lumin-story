<p>Throughout the DeltaLumin Pilot Program there were five in-person events including two kick-off events and three pilot participant workshops. The purpose of these events was to gain insight into the participants’ reactions to the forms in which DeltaLumin communicates their energy use data. This was accomplished through open-ended discussion, written surveys, and facilitated activities.</p>

		<h4>Pilot Kick-Off Event: Introduction to the Program</h4>
		<p>The objective of the kick-off event activity was to develop a baseline for both a participant’s personal energy use and their understanding of energy. In anticipation of the first Energy Update, which would include an Appliance Spending Diagnosis outlining estimated energy use per appliance, the activity aimed to better understand how participants currently think about the energy consumption of individual appliances.</p>
		<p>We found that participants did not have a consistent understanding of what items in their home were contributing the most to their monthly energy spending. There was discussion around not only how much energy particular appliances and electronics use, but also how they are used by participants and their families. We found that there were significant connections between energy use behaviors and feelings of safety (i.e. participants leaving TVs or lights on overnight to feel safe). We also found that there was misinformation about how appliances and electronics use energy when turned on and off.</p>

		<h4>Workshop 1: Reactions to first Energy Updates</h4>
		<p>The objective of the first pilot participant workshop was to solicit feedback from participants about the clarity and effectiveness of the energy updates. The activity involved both discussing the layout and design of the information presented in the energy updates and allowing participants to change their answers to the appliance ranking activity that took place during the kick-off event based on information they had received in the first energy update (most notably the Appliance Spending Diagnosis).</p>
		<p>We found that most participants significantly changed their answers to the ranking activity after seeing their first energy update. We also found through our conversations about the energy updates that participants appreciated the simplicity and clarity of the information that was being communicated. They also liked the use of dollars rather than kWh to show quantity of energy consumed. Participants found the appliance diagnosis most interesting, however the accuracy of information was a concern as we continued to refine our model for predicting appliance-level energy consumption. </p>

		<h4>Workshop 2: Setting Energy Savings Goals</h4>
		<p>The objective of the second pilot participant workshop was to introduce participants to the idea of setting energy savings goals and understand participant thought processes around setting goals. The activity involved presenting participants with the energy use and occupancy information hypothetical household with a specific energy savings goal and asking participants to work together to identify the most feasible and effective ways to meet their goals. At the end of the activity, participants were asked to set their own energy savings goal.</p> 
		<p>When participants were presented with possible actions that could be taken to reduce energy use, many were very surprised by which actions would yield the greatest savings. The goals that were set at the end of the workshop were generally more feasible than the savings goals that were discussed in the early research phase with focus groups and individuals prior to the pilot period. </p>
