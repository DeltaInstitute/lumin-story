<p>The DeltaLumin pilot program included five in-person events: two kick-off events and three pilot participant workshops. At the workshops, we listened to the participants as they told us their first-hand experience with our material. Participant feedback was collected via written surveys, facilitated activities, and open-ended discussions. Each workshop is described below including its objective, a summary of the hands-on activity, and the results we drew from each experience.</p>

		<h4>Pilot Kick-Off Events: Introduction to the Program</h4>

		<p>The objective of the kick-off event activity was to introduce participants the program/pilot, meet team members in person, and to gather baseline information on their attitudes, opinion, and energy use. In anticipation of the first Energy Update, which would include an Appliance Spending Diagnosis outlining estimated energy use per appliance, the activity aimed to better understand how participants currently think about the energy consumption of individual appliances. Participants were asked to rank appliances and electronic devices based on how much money each contributes to their monthly energy bill.</p>
		<p>We found that participants did not have a consistent understanding of which items in their home were contributing the most to their monthly energy spending. There was discussion around not only how much energy particular appliances and electronics use, and how they are used by participants and other members of their households. We found that participants had significant connections between energy use behaviors and feelings of safety (i.e. participants leaving TVs or lights on overnight to feel safe). We also found that there was misinformation about how appliances and electronics use energy when turned on and off.</p>

		

		<h4>Workshop 1: Reactions to First Energy Updates</h4>

		<p>The objective of the first pilot participant workshop was to solicit feedback from participants about the clarity and effectiveness of the energy updates they had received in the previous month. The features that were evaluated included the the forecast feature and appliance-level energy use feature.  During the activity participants discussed the layout and design of the information presented in the energy updates. Participants were also given an opportunity to change their answers to the appliance ranking activity that took place during the kick-off event based on information they had received in the first energy update, most notably the Appliance Spending Diagnosis.</p>
		<p>We found that participants appreciated the simplicity and clarity of the information being communicated. They also liked the use of dollars rather than kWh to show the quantity of energy being consumed. Participants found the appliance diagnosis to be the most interesting; however, the accuracy of information was a concern as we continued to refine our model for predicting appliance-level energy consumption. </p>

		<h4>Workshop 2: Setting Energy Savings Goals</h4>

		<p>The objective of the second pilot participant workshop was to introduce participants to the idea of setting energy savings goals and to understand participant thought processes around setting goals in other areas of their lives. The activity presented participants with the energy use and occupancy information for a hypothetical household along with a specific energy savings goal for that hypothetical household. Participants were then asked to work together to identify the most feasible and effective ways to meet the household’s savings goals from a list of conservation and efficiency energy-saving actions. At the end of the activity, participants were asked to set their own energy savings goal. Participants were given personalized goal setting cards with suggested savings goals of 5%, 10%, and 15% with dollar savings calculated using their historic use for that month. </p> 
		<p>From the the hypothetical household activity, we found that participants were surprised by which conservation actions would yield the greatest savings. The savings, upfront costs, and returns on investment for large efficiency actions (all but replacing light bulbs) were generally what participants expected. The goals set at the end of this workshop were generally more feasible than the savings goals discussed in the project’s early research phase: an energy savings goal of 5% was chosen by 60% of workshop participants; in contrast, during the initial research phases of the DeltaLumin project, common responses to a similar prompt included saving $20 or more on a bill of $100, or over 80%. </p>

		<h4>Workshop 3: Matching Participants with Existing Utility Programs</h4>

		<p>The objective of the third and final pilot participant workshop was to introduce participants to existing utility programs that match their current lifestyle, home types, and appliances, and to gauge their willingness to participate in such programs. The activity at the final workshop involved discussing several existing utility programs, providing hypothetical household scenarios, and listening to which utility programs the participants chose for their hypothetical households. We gained insight into participants’ processes for balancing the risks and benefits of participating in these programs.</p>
		<p>We found that although some participants had participated or considered participating in the programs covered in the activity, many had not. Participants were generally hesitant to commit to ongoing programs that could result in compromised comfort, but appreciated information on one-off programs that provide one-time incentives without giving up comfort or flexibility. They also appreciated the customized information provided on the estimated savings for participating in each program. </p>
