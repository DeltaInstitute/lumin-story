<p>To enable participants to contact  DeltaLumin team members directly with questions or concerns, we created the “DeltaLumin Hotline,” and provided an email and phone number. The Hotline was staffed from 1-4pm Monday - Thursday. During this time, a member of the DeltaLumin team would be responsible for answering calls and emails, responding to any missed calls and emails, and manually entering any surveys or workshop RSVP's received. To ensure good customer service and consistency among team members, we created a customer service manual, which included phone and email etiquette, FAQ’s, strategies to handle tough questions, Desk Duty Responsibilities, and instructions on how to use Salesforce.</p>
 
<p>We used Salesforce to manage all of our participant contact information, track participant communications, and track workshop attendance and payments. In using this tools, we were able to streamline the transition between team members at desk duty, as well as prep for any follow up communications and troubleshooting.  </p>

<p>DeltaLumin staff also used the “desk duty” time to follow up with participants whose surveys were incomplete or to confirm their eligibility. During the enrollment period, having a person available to answer questions about the pilot and expectations of participant commitments was an important part in building a trusting relationship with participants.</p>
 
<p>During the pilot implementation phase, the volume of calls and emails was drastically reduced. Participants would use the Hotline to RSVP for an upcoming workshop or to get workshop details. After each workshop, we reached out to all participants who did not attend and gave them the opportunity to make up the survey.</p>

<p>For the population enrolled in the pilot, phone communication was the most popular communication channel. During the pilot implementation phase a total of 17% of participants communicated with us via email, while 29% communicated with us via phone.
