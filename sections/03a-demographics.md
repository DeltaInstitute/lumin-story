title: Demographic and Geographic Priorities
---

<p>Delta focused on identifying pilot participants that had smart meters in their homes and fit with ISEIFâ€™s priority demographic characteristics, including low-income households and seniors. Delta conducted research to identify the geographic areas throughout Chicago where smart meters had already been installed and that were largely low-income communities. Faith in Place led the on-the-ground recruitment efforts focusing their attention on places of worship in the areas of high priority. </p>
