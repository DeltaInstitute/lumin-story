<p>The primary research question was whether the illumination of energy use data will lead low-income energy consumers to engage with their energy use beyond the level of engagement that occurs with the use of traditional monthly bills? Where illumination of energy use involves translating household energy use into personalized information about participantsâ€™ energy habits and patterns. Engagement includes demonstrating energy use reduction through action, stating an intention to reduce energy use, and/or indicating that an informed decision was made to not reduce energy use. Low-income energy consumers include individuals with a household income at or below 50% AMI (< 150% FPL) who are not currently receiving energy subsidies (e.g. CEDA, LIHEAP).</p>
<p>Energy use was illuminated using four different features include:</p>
<ul>1. <strong>Spending Forecast</strong>, which tested if energy spending updates at a shorter interval (daily rather than monthly) leads to increased levels of engagement over those receiving traditional monthly bills</ul>
<ul>2. <strong>Appliance Spending Diagnosis</strong>, which tested if appliance-level energy consumption information is a more accessible illumination of energy use leading to increased levels of engagement over those receiving traditional monthly bills</ul>
<ul>3. <strong>Energy Savings Goal</strong>, which tested if facilitating energy savings goals among participants leads to increased levels of engagement over those receiving traditional monthly bills</ul>
<ul>4. <strong>Program Match</strong>, which tested if a curated list of existing utility programs based on actual household energy use data will lead to increased levels of engagement over those receiving traditional monthly bills</ul>
<p>Each feature was delivered to participants in one or more of the following channels of communication per their stated preference:</p>
<ul>1. <strong>Mail</strong> (push/analog)</ul>
<ul>2. <strong>Email</strong> (push/digital)</ul>
<ul>3. <strong>Website</strong> (fetch/digital)</ul>
