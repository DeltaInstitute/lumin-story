<p>Throughout the DeltaLumin Pilot Program there were five in-person events including two kick-off events and three pilot participant workshops. The purpose of these events was to gain insight into the participantsâ€™ reactions to the forms in which DeltaLumin communicates their energy use data. This was accomplished through open-ended discussion, written surveys, and facilitated activities.</p>
