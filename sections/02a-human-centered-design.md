<p>Delta worked with design firm <a href="http://ideo.com">IDEO</a> to take a human-centered design approach to the development and piloting of the DeltaLumin product and service. Human-centered design is rooted in a comprehensive understanding of the needs, values, and motivations of the potential users of the product or service being designed. The process often begins with intensive field research that results in specific insights that are then combined with design strategies to develop new products or services that meet the needs of the people who use them.</p>

<p>The initial research efforts in the DeltaLumin approach were led by IDEO and included in-home interviews with potential users and later small group discussions around different possibilities for communicating personalized energy use information enabled by smart meter technology. Some insights that surfaced as a result included:</p>

<ul> 
	<li>People want to see their information put in their context.</li>
	<li>People want to have flexibility when paying their utility bills.</li>
	<li>People want to identify problem areas and set goals to fix them.</li>
	<li>People want to be able to give back to their communities.</li>
</ul>

<p>Themes of human-centered design continued throughout the pilot in the implementation of monthly workshops and the iteration of the energy model used to provide energy updates and the visual language used to communicate with pilot participants. </p>
