        <p><a href="http://delta-institute.org">Delta Institute</a> is a nonprofit working to build a resilient Great Lakes environment and economy through sustainable solutions. One of Delta's <a href="http://delta-institute.org/objectives/">strategic objectives</a> is to <em>disrupt the energy status quo</em> by helping buildings become more efficient, creating strategies to increase renewable energy generation, and, in the case of DeltaLumin, working directly with consumers to understand how they use and manage their energy and develop effective strategies for behavior change.</p>

        <p>Delta has ten years of experience working directly with homeowners on energy conservation. For years, we implemented a home weatherization program to educate homeowners on where their homes were energy inefficient and guide them toward solutions. For DeltaLumin, we wanted to flip our top-down program approach and instead start with the energy users.</p>

        <p>With funding from the Illinois Science & Energy Innovation Foundation (<a href="http://www.iseif.org/">ISEIF</a>), we set out to apply the principles of human-centered design to inform the creation and piloting of a product or service that, based on an understanding of individual users, would leverage insights from smart meter data to help consumers make smarter energy decisions. We initiated a partnership with renowned design firm <a href="http://www.ideo.com/">IDEO</a>, whose expertise in human-centered design informed our on-the-ground research and the design of great product concepts. Because smart meter program uptake lagged in low-income, senior and "<a href="http://www.iseif.org/apply/faq/">hard-to-reach</a>" communities, we focused our outreach to those communities.  To help us connect with those communities, we brought on one of our long-time partners, <a href="http://www.faithinplace.org/">Faith in Place</a>, who led community outreach and recruitment efforts.</p>
