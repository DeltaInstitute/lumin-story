    <h3>Measures</h3>
		<p>Results of the pilot will be evaluated using a mixed methods approach. Taking a mixed methods approach involves employing both qualitative and quantitative strategies of inquiry (e.g. numeric information like energy use data collected concurrently to text information through open-ended survey questions). This approach will be used because the indicators of successful engagement include both changes in measurable energy use and changes in non-numeric opinions, motivations, and intentions related to energy use. Indicators of participant engagement include:</p>
