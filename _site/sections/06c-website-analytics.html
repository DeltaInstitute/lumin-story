	<p>Throughout the DeltaLumin Pilot Program there were five in-person events including two kick-off events and three pilot participant workshops. The purpose of these events was to gain insight into the participants’ reactions to the forms in which DeltaLumin communicates their energy use data. This was accomplished through open-ended discussion, written surveys, and facilitated activities.</p>
