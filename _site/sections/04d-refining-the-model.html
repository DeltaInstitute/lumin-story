    <h3>Refining the Model</h3>
		<p>The pilot provided valuable information about the limitations of monthly data in giving users useful energy information, even when the data is well-modeled. Users need at least day-after data to make any action or decisions on purchases. The availability of this data is also important. Though our development product is able to take monthly data and work through algorithms to process it into passable daily data, a daily feed is much more likely to return accurate data and recommendations.</p>
