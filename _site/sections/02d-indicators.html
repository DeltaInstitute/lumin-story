    <h3>Indicators of Engagement</h3>
		<p>A human-centered design approach inherently accepts that there are many different and valid ways in which customers may value and use energy, and a design process that empathizes with their value systems will be more effective in providing overall benefit. </p>

<p>Results of the pilot were evaluated using a mixed methods approach, which involves employing both qualitative and quantitative strategies of inquiry (e.g. numeric information like energy use data collected concurrently to text information through open-ended survey questions). This approach was used because the indicators of successful engagement include both changes in measurable energy use and changes in non-numeric opinions, motivations, and intentions related to energy use. Indicators of participant engagement included:</p>
