    <h3>Synthesizing the Workshop Series</h3>
		<p>Throughout the pilot, DeltaLumin team members interacted with participants directly at monthly workshops. Though we were aware of the interference in-person interaction with participants could have on their survey responses, the workshop format allowed us to capture valuable unstructured feedback from our participants in these early stages of product development.</p>

<p>Several themes found in the workshops informed the iteration of the DeltaLumin suite of features throughout the pilot, and continue to influence the development of DeltaLumin. These themes include:</p>

<ul class="workshopTakeaways">
	<li>A gap in existing user knowledge</li>
	<ul class="takeawayDetails">
		<li>Participants did not have a consistent understanding of which items in their home contributed the most to their monthly energy spending</li>
		<li>Many participants were surprised to learn which conservations actions would yield the greatest energy savings</li>
	</ul>
	<li>A desire for clarity in data representation</li>
	<ul class="takeawayDetails">
		<li>Participants appreciated simplicity and clarity in the presentation of energy use information</li>
		<li>The use of dollars rather than kWh to show the quantity of energy consumed resonated with participants</li>
	</ul>
	<li>An appreciation of personalized information</li>
	<ul class="takeawayDetails">
		<li>Participants appreciated customized estimated savings for participating in each program</li>
		<li>Suggesting goals led participants to set more reasonable energy savings goals</li>
		<li>Participants found the appliance spending diagnosis compelling, however the accuracy and applicability of information was a concern to them</li>
	</ul>
	<li>A finite willingness to commit to changing behavior affecting energy use</li>
	<ul class="takeawayDetails">
		<li>There were significant connections between energy use behaviors and feelings of safety</li>
		<li>Participants were generally hesitant to commit to ongoing programs that could result in compromised comfort or unpredictable bills, but appreciated information on one-off programs that provide one-time incentives without giving up comfort or flexibility</li>
	</ul>
</ul>
