    <h3>Recruitment</h3>
		<p>Delta focused on identifying pilot participants that had smart meters in their homes and fit with ISEIFâ€™s priority demographic characteristics, including low-income households and seniors. Delta conducted research to identify the geographic areas throughout Chicago where smart meters had already been installed and that were largely low-income communities. Faith in Place led the on-the-ground recruitment efforts focusing their attention on places of worship in the areas of high priority.</p>

<p>The Faith in Place recruitment team visited several places of worship throughout the recruitment period. Faith in Place was crucial in developing and communicating the value of the program to potential participants, administering eligibility surveys, and sustaining engagement through the enrollment process and beyond.</p>
