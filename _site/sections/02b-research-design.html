<p>Throughout the pilot period, participants were exposed to several methods of energy illumination. Energy use was illuminated using four different features including:</p>

<p>Results of the pilot will be evaluated using a mixed methods approach. Taking a mixed methods approach involves employing both qualitative and quantitative strategies of inquiry (e.g. numeric information like energy use data collected concurrently to text information through open-ended survey questions). This approach will be used because the indicators of successful engagement include both changes in measurable energy use and changes in non-numeric opinions, motivations, and intentions related to energy use. Indicators of participant engagement include:</p>

<ol>
	<li><strong>Conservation intention:</strong> consumer indicates the intent to reduce energy use through behavior change within or following the pilot period</li>
	<li><strong>Conservation action:</strong> consumer demonstrates energy use reduction through behavior change within the pilot period</li>
	<li><strong>Efficiency intention:</strong> consumer indicates the intention to reduce energy use through physical improvements to their homes including the replacement of an inefficient appliance within or following the pilot period</li>
	<li><strong>Efficiency action:</strong> consumer demonstrates energy use reduction through physical improvements to their home including the replacement of an inefficient appliance within the pilot period</li>
	<li><strong>Informed decision not to act:</strong> consumer demonstrates receipt and indicates understanding of energy use illumination information and chooses not to take action to reduce energy use</li>
</ol>

<p>These indicators of participant engagement were measured using a concurrent triangulation of methods including:</p>

<ol>
	<li><strong>Monthly Workshop Activities &amp; Discussion:</strong> Participants were required to attend monthly in-person events to share reactions and insights related to the features they interacted with the previous month. Qualitative data was collected in the form of responses to open-ended discussion questions and reactions to interactive group activities. </li>
	<li><strong>Monthly surveys:</strong> Monthly surveys were distributed and completed at each Monthly Workshop. These were mixed method surveys with an emphasis on close-ended questions, but with open-ended questions included as necessary aiming to collect information about opinions, motivations, and intentions related to energy use generally and treatments more specifically.</li>
	<li><strong>Website analytics:</strong> Email views and/or website visits were tracked by user and by date/time to aid in the analysis of changes in both energy use seen in the collected energy use data and/or changes in opinions, motivations, and intentions captured in monthly surveys.</li>
</ol>
